    <!-- HEADLINE -->
<p>Hemlock Vale spoilers starting. One of the cards teased: Long Shot.</p>
<p>Viability: Definitely a card that will see pretty wide use. Long Shot is Survivor Vicious Blow. Trades one icon for broader targeting. Is also <em><strong>Practiced</strong></em>, which means Amanda can take it and it can be searched with Practice Makes Perfect.</p>
<p>But we're here to talk about the throwing of bricks and answer the question: What is the farthest you can throw a brick using Long Shot?</p>
<h3>Spoiler Warning</h3>
<p>Every scenario is discussed</p>
<h3>Ground Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>Locations must be specific enough to be measurable</li>
<li>Space-warping shenanigans that put two locations closer together</li>
</ol>
<h3>List of scenarios that take place over broader areas, initial filter</h3>
<ul>
<li>Night of the Zealot: Entirely takes place in Arkham and surrounding woods.
<ul>
<li>The Gathering: Definitely some spacial weirdness, especially with Return to adding Far Above and Far Below, but clearly takes place roughly within a single lot.</li>
<li>The Midnight Masks: All within Arkham.</li>
<li>The Devourer Below: All within woods surrounding Arkham.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dunwich
<ul>
<li>EA: All within Miskatonic U</li>
<li>HAW, MM, ECE: All within one building/train</li>
<li>BotA, U&amp;U, WDA: All within Dunwich</li>
<li>LiTaS: Best candidate, but seems likely to violate Rule 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carcosa</li>
</ul>
<h3>In search of the mythical two-location yeet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most ways don't work, since the <em>enemy</em>, not the <em>test</em>, must be at a connecting location. That means you need to be committing as if <em>you</em> were at another location.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enter Luke, king of &quot;as if&quot;</h3>
<!-- Clueless.gif -->
<ul>
<li>Luke?? Can Luke grant an action during which a fight event takes place?
<ul>
<li>What if your ally had Quick Thinking? Honed Instinct?</li>
<li>What if you granted an evade to an enemy and they had a .25 automatic with a telescopic sight?</li>
<li>If your ally had Quick Thinking or Honed Instinct or drew The Stars Are Right while you were resolving your event at another location</li>
<li>Unclear if this violates rule 2</li>
<li>You play Drawn to the Flame or Delve to Deep and hit your ally's Honed Instinct trigger. They use their action to attack an enemy at another location using Enchanted Bow. You are still &quot;as if&quot; at their location. So while you are physically at location A, you throw the brick as if you are at location B (since the event is still resolving), and achieve the holy grail of the 2-location YEET.</li>
<li>With Dream-Gate, any two revealed locations are two connections away. So you would stand at A, play Delve too Deep as if you were at the Dream-Gate, your teammate would take an action that allows them to fight with enchanted bow, and you would yeet the brick!</li>
<li>Depends on how you interpret the flavor of Luke. Is he actually physically there, or astral projecting?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fun</h3>
<p>Dream-Gate violates rule 1, but is still fun
Machinations lets you yeet into a different time, though it might violate rule 2</p>
<h4>Things that don't work</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minh's Analytical Mind</li>
<li>Open Gate</li>
<li>Decoy; automatic evasion doesn't cause a skill test</li>
<li>Two-location yeets with Enchanted Bow, Marksmanship, etc. Long Shot says &quot;ENEMY AT&quot; so the enemy's location is what matters, not the skill test location.</li>
</ul>
